# Newman

## Why?

Newman v4.0 drops support for Node v4 and deprecated v2 CLI options. Also, the inbuilt HTML reporter has been moved to a standalone reporter.

## Updating to Newman v4 from older versions

If you're updating from an older version of Newman, make sure you read the rest of this document, to understand the changes.

#### 1. Install Newman v4
```console
$ npm install -g newman  # Install newman globally
```

#### 2. Check Installation
```console
$ newman --version  # Should show the latest version of Newman
```

## V3 to V4 migration guide:

### Upgrading Node.js
Newman v4 requires Node.js >= v6. [Install Node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

### Discontinued CLI Options
Newman v4 drops support for all the deprecated v2 CLI options, check [Newman v2 to v3 migration guide](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/blob/release/3.x/MIGRATION.md#cli).<br/>
For the complete list of supported options, see the [README](README.md)

### Using HTML Reporter
The inbuilt HTML reporter has been moved to a standalone reporter. Install it with:
```console
$ npm install -g newman-reporter-html
```
Installation should be global if newman is installed globally, local otherwise. (Remove `-g` flag from the above command for a local installation.)

The complete installation and usage guide is available here: https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman-reporter-html

### CSV auto parse
A [fix][pr1609] has been made to avoid parsing numbers inside quotes.<br/>
Example, `"000123"` will not be parsed to `123` like before.

Fixes issues: [#1100][i1100], [#1215][i1215] & [#1346][i1346]

### Default timeouts
All timeouts now have the default value of infinity. [#1630](pr1630)
