# newman <sub>_the cli companion for postman_</sub>

Using Newman one can effortlessly run and test a Postman Collections directly from the command-line. It is built with
extensibility in mind so that you can easily integrate it with your continuous integration servers and build systems.

> *BETA RELEASE NOTES*
>
> To use newan v3.x beta, ensure that you install using the beta tag: `npm install newman@next`.
>
> The beta version of `newman v3.x` is currently under development and is not intended for production use. Details
> outlining the limitations and roadmap of newman v3.x is outlined in [BETA.md](BETA.md).


## Getting started

Newman is built using NodeJS v4+. To run Newman, make sure you have NodeJS version 4 or above installed. The latest
version of NodeJS can be easily installed by following instructions mentioned at
[https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

The easiest way to install Newman is using NPM. If you have NodeJS installed, it is most likely that you have NPM
installed as well.

```terminal
$ npm install newman --global;
```

If you are using Newman for a specific project, you may ignore the `--global` install argument and consequently, newman
will only be available for use within the specific directory where you installed it.

### Using Newman Commandline

The `newman run` command allows you to specify a collection to be run. You can easily export your Postman
Collection as a json file from the Postman App and run it using Newman.

```terminal
$ newman run examples/sample-collection.json;
```

Run a collection from URL
```terminal
$ newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv;
```

For the whole list of options refer to the Commandline Options section below.

### Using Newman as a NodeJS module

Newman can be easily used within your JavaScript projects as a NodeJS module. All functionalities of the newman command line is available for programmatic use.

The following example runs a collection by reading a JSON collection file stored on disk.

```javascript
var newman = require('newman'); // require newman in your project

// call newman.run to pass `options` object and wait for callback
newman.run({
    collection: require('./sample-collection.json'),
    reporters: 'cli'
}, function (err) {
	if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

The newman v2.x `.execute` function has been deprecated and will be discontinued in future.
